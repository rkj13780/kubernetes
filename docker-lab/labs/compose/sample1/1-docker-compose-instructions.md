# Using docker compose

## Docker Compose and The Docker-compose.yml File
Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

cat docker-compose.yml

docker-compose up

## To run the services in the background and provide you back with a shell
